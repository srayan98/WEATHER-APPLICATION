# WEATHER-APPLICATION
I have started working on the Weather application project that would be useful to access weather data of any city in the world. 
I am using html to provide the necessary structure including a searchbar to let the user look for their desired city's weather alongside a search button.
Users will also have the option to search the weather via their current location.
I have utilised tailwind CSS to stylise the respective fields so that the users have better experience while accessing weather data.
This is the Github link for the entire application: https://github.com/srayan98/WEATHER-APPLICATION/tree/main
